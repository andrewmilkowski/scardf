scardf fork from code.google.com/p/scardf and port to scala 2.8.0 (with maven and sbt)

as per original description of the project, scardf is:
"
Scardf is an API in Scala providing a DSL for writing, traversing and querying RDF graphs. Implemented as a faÃ§ade to Jena, an RDF programming framework for Java."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:

Sbt pulls incorrect jena and ira jar's from repo1.maven.org repository (but only jena 2.6.3, 2.6.2 version resolves fine)

and all this despite explicit dependency directive:) 

sbt dependency

lazy val jena = "com.hp.hpl.jena" % "jena" % JENA_VERSION % "compile->default"

sbt stack trace:
